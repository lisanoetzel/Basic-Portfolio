            <p>Hello~Hola~Bonjour~Buongiorno! My name is Lisa Mameli Noetzel and this is my very first Web Portfolio page. As you can probably guess, I speak multiple (Romance) languages as well as English, which is my native tongue.   
            </p>
            <p>My interest in languages has been a life-long passion which, has helped me in various career paths: teaching, translating/interpreting and, currently, web development. I enjoy working and interacting with people from different countries/cultures, and I look forward to many more international experiences as a Full-Stack/Front-End Developer!
            </p>
            <p>In the links above, please feel free to send me a message with your comments and/or feedback about this website and my other projects listed in this portfolio.
            </p>
